# basic-programs
I've been playing around in old versions of Microsoft BASIC on emulated 8-bit computers and came up with a couple cool programs I wanted to archive here.

* Petplot - simple subroutine to plot a single character in some x,y location on the screen of a commodore computer.
* Dual Orbit - a program that simulates two orbiting bodies in 2D space <br><img src="screenshots/three_to_one.png" width="200"/>
