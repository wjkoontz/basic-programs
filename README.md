# basic-programs
I've been playing around in old versions of Microsoft BASIC on emulated 8-bit computers and came up with a couple cool programs I wanted to archive here.

* [Petplot](petplot.md) - simple subroutine to plot a single character in some x,y location on the screen of a commodore computer.
* [Dual Orbit](dualorbit.md) - a program that simulates two orbiting bodies in 2D space <br><img src="screenshots/three_to_one.png" width="200"/>
* [Trajectory](trajectory.md) - A program that plots the trajectory of a projectile launched with a certian velocity at a certain angle. <br><img src="screenshots/trajectory.png" width="200"/>
